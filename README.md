## Rules of the project

In short:
	-**Backend - File** management system
	- **Frontend - Inventory** management system 

You must develop a simple file management system 
Create a command-line program that allows users to perform basic file operations such as : 
 - creating new files 
 - deleting files
 - [PLUS] listing files in a directory 
 - [PLUS] searching for files based on criteria.
the system must support text and binary files 

Your main function should be very minimal;
