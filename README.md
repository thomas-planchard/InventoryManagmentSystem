## Rules of the project

In short:
	-**Backend - File** management system
	- **Frontend - Inventory** management system 

You must develop a simple file management system 
Create a command-line program that allows users to perform basic file operations such as : 
 - creating new files 
 - deleting files
 - [PLUS] listing files in a directory 
 - [PLUS] searching for files based on criteria.
the system must support text and binary files 

Your main function should be very minimal;
Don't open files (only for previewing/debugging)
Create appropriate utility functions for the frontend 

### Frontend Overview

Develop a basic Inventory Management System. Each product is represented by a record containing information such as 
- product id 
- name 
- quantity 
- price 
The users of your frontend should be able to:
- read and write report (text files)

Records operations should include :
 - ADD
 - View
 - search
 - Update 
 - Delete



## Frontend functions


## Backend functions

### File management system

#### Write in a file

```c
int writeFile(char *fileName, char *content);
```

#### Create a file

```c
int createFile(char *fileName);
```

#### Delete a file

```c
int deleteFile(char *fileName);
```

#### List files in a directory

```c
int listFiles(char *directoryName);
```

#### Search for files based on criteria

```c
int searchFiles(char *directoryName, char *criteria);
```

#### Add report


Make a CLI Inventory management system coded in C that will work as follows:

The program MUST access a directory containing a database.bin file which it will load as the inventory and use as persistent storage. 
the program MUST also be able to read/write txt files for writing and generating reports.

the databse must be populated with 10 products following this struct.

typedef struct {
	char id[10];
	char name[50];
	int quantity;
	double price;
} Product_t

- Launch the program:
	- Press 1 for: Make a transaction (add or remove or modify an item)
		- Press 1 for: for: Add a product (receive stocks)
			- Database must be loaded => product is selected by its ID by the user => select quantity to increase stock => confirmation message => back to "Make a transaction" menu.
		- Press 2 for: Remove a product (sell stuff)
			- Dabase must be loaded => product is selected by its ID by the user => select quantity to decrease stock => confirmation message => back to "Make a transaction" menu.
		- Press 3 for: Modify (change price, or name or etc.)
			- Database must be loaded => product is selected by its ID by the user => select attribute to modify => change attribute value
		- Press 9 for: Back()
	- Press 2 for: Inventory
		- Press 1 for: Display the whole inventory
			- Database must be loaded => list all the the 10 items that populate the database
			- Press 9 for: Back()
		- Press 2 for: Search an item given its ID and display a detailed view
		- Press 9 for: Back()
	- Press 3 for: Reports
		- Press 1 for: List Reports
			- Press 1 for: List all reports 
			- Press 9 for: Back()
		- Press 2 for: Write a new report
		- Press 9 for: Back()
	- Press 9 for: Exit()
